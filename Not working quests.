First one, "Noggle's Last Hope" I got all the items in my bag, still cannot turn in quest because the quest npc seems to think I don't have the quest items.

Second one, "Vyral the Vile" the quest mob that are supose to be killed doesn't excist. I've talked to a GM about this and checked that the mob actually doesn't excist.

Third one, 'Eastern Crystal Pylon' in Un'Goro Crater does not work properly. I have 10 green, 10 blue stones/gems or what ever still cannot get the 'Crystal Force' items from the 'Eastern Crystal Pylon' which are needed for exampel the 8 agility head/leg enchant.

That's what I've had problems with so far. Please fix it.
